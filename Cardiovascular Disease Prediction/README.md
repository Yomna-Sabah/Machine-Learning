## Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

 - Implement Decision Tree using ID3 algorithm.
 - Use Kaggle [cardiovascular disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) to train a model and test the performance using accuracy metric.
 - Any needed data preprocessing is done to increase model performance.
 - Create and train another decision tree instance using scikit-learn library (uses same algorithm - ID3).
 - Compare between both models taking into consideration time needed for training, time for prediction, and model performance
